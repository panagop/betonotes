# Getting Started

Welcome to the getting started guide for Betonotes!

## What is Jupyter Book?

Jupyter Book is a powerful tool for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational content. With version 2, it provides even better features for:

- **Interactive notebooks**: Execute Python code directly in your documentation
- **MyST Markdown**: Write rich content with enhanced Markdown syntax
- **Cross-references**: Link between pages and sections easily
- **Code execution**: Run code cells and display outputs

## Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

```
betonotes/
├── book/              # Jupyter Book content
│   ├── myst.yml      # Book configuration
│   ├── intro.md      # Home page
│   └── *.md          # Your content pages
├── src/              # Python source code
